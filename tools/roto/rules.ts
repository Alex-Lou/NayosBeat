/**
 * What `npm run sprites` would say about the cell this tool just made.
 *
 * The pipeline already owns a rules engine — `checkDrawn` (tools/sprites/drawn-rules.ts), the one
 * the Aseprite extension mirrors and that refuses a drawing before anything is generated. Rather
 * than write a lookalike here, the page runs **that** engine on its own output. So what the tool
 * says is what the pipeline will say, now and after the rules change; nothing to keep in step by
 * hand (loi de Hyrum, CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * Only the geometric rules can apply: the output is truecolour, so everything about palette slots
 * is out of reach (docs/art/roto.md §1). What is left is worth having — the 4 px kept clear along
 * the cell's edges is a real rule, stricter than "does the subject fit", and the one a rotoscoped
 * subject breaks most often.
