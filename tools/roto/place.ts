/**
 * The subject put on a sprite cell (docs/art/roto.md §3): scaled to the fighters' height and set
 * down with the soles on the game's anchor, so that what comes out of the tool is already in the
 * frame the game draws in — the one thing a generic pixel-art converter never does.
 *
 * Two rules come from the pipeline and are not options:
 *
 * - the last row of the feet sits on the anchor row (src/art/types.ts `ANCHOR`, row 248 of a
 *   256 px cell), and the centre of the feet on its column, in every frame;
 * - no half-transparent pixel (docs/art/aseprite.md): the resampling keeps the coverage to average
 *   the colours, then alpha is either on or off at half coverage.
 *
 * The resampling is by areas, in linear light, and only over the subject's pixels: an output pixel
 * is the exact average of the source it covers, with the background left out, so the silhouette's
 * edge never picks up the colour of the wall behind it. Where the source is smaller than the
 * target the areas fall under one pixel and it becomes a nearest copy, which is what pixel art
 * wants anyway — nothing is interpolated (D23).
