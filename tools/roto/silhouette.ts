/**
 * The subject's silhouette in an imported image (docs/art/roto.md §2): what the tool keeps, and
 * what is background. Two ways, tried in this order.
 *
 * - **The image already says it.** Enough transparent pixels and the alpha channel is the answer:
 *   a Blender render, a generated PNG on a transparent background, a drawing already cut out.
 * - **The background is keyed out.** A flood fill starts at the four corners, each keeping its own
 *   reference colour, and spreads while a pixel stays within `tolerance` of that corner (ΔE in
 *   Lab). Four references, so a wall and a floor of two different colours both go; the reference
 *   never moves, so a fill cannot drift along a soft edge into the subject the way a fill compared
 *   to its neighbour would. The corners are used rather than the whole border because feet often
 *   touch the bottom edge of a photo, and a fill seeded on the feet would eat the fighter.
 *
 * Then the specks go: the largest island is kept, and so is any island at least `minShare` of it
 * (a detached hand, a weapon, hair). A hole inside the subject is kept by construction — the fill
 * never reaches it.
 *
 * The limit is known and is the method's, not a bug: this works on a plain background (a wall, a
 * studio backdrop, a render) and fails on a busy one. A photo against a bookshelf needs a
 * segmentation model, which this tool does not have.
